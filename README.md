# mmna-graphs 

A collaberative project between @phinanix and @ohAitch to search for additional examples of [Minor Minimal Non-apex Graphs](google.com)(MMNA graphs). [Previous work](todo.com) only searched up to examples on 10 vertices, but with clever techniques and performant code I suspect exhaustive search up to at least 12-13 vertices is possible without an exorbitant number of core-hours. 

## Algorithms 
* Planarity Checking ([DMP](todo.com) also spell out DMP)
* Apex and MMNA checking (using heuristics)
* Enumeration of graph minors
* Graph Canonicalization/Automorphism/Isomorphism (in-progress)
* Enumeration of Planar / Apex / MMNA candidate graphs a la [planitri](todo.com)
